## Inspiration
Pipelines carrying oil and gas in the United States are not adequately regulated, inspected, or enforced. The three types of pipelines: natural gas transmission lines, which transport natural gas from production areas to processing plants and municipal distribution areas, liquids (including oil), and natural gas distribution lines, which transport gas from plants to customers, all have a troubled history of spills, contamination, injuries, and deaths.
Millions of miles of pipelines in the US have resulted in the following: 
1. more than 5,500 total incidents
2. almost 600 injuries
3. more than 125 fatalities
4. more than 800 fires
5. almost 300 explosions
6. more than $4 billion in damages
7. almost 30,000 people who had to be evacuated
